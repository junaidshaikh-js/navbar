## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- [Sass](https://sass-lang.com/) - CSS extension language
- CSS Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

- I used `height` and `overflow: hidden` property to add transition to the navbar on mobile view and to toggle the navbar. When using `display: none` property to hide and show the navbar you can't add transition to the element resulting sudden display and hide of the element which doesn't look good.

- I also learned about `Node.contains()` Javascript DOM property which return true if the element is the decendant of the node (including itself) on which its called otherwise returns false.
